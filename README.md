# Text Classification

In this project, we performed Text Classification With Python and Keras.
We did sentiment analysis on three datasets:

    * **yelp** - accuracy: 0.796
    * **Amazon** - accuracy: 0.796
    * **IMDB** - Accuracy: 0.748

We used `pandas` to read datasets, and `sklearn` to build the baseline mode.
Also, we trained the model in _Neural Network_ using `keras` and `tensorflow`.
Results are plotted using `matplotlib`.
